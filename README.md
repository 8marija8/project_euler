# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the mathematical/computer programming problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), written in JavaScript and Python.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging problems that require creative problem-solving skills and mathematical insights to solve. Each problem is designed to be solved with computer programming, although a mathematical solution is also possible in many cases.
